# guiMatlabRealtimeCmd
Create a GUI for you to input your command, which will be the input parameter of function 'eval'.
Insert scPara_Ctrl wherever you want the command to be evaluated (but only one window will be allowed).
An Example of use this script is in folder "Example"

This is a script I created to ease parameter modification when I'm demonstrating a stimuli in a psychphysics experiment.
With it I can modify whatever variables in the same workspace where the scPara_Ctrl is called.
